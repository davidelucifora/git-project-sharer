## Project Description

While studying for my JS course I noticed that having to share my repos and live versions of my assignments on the Discord server of with other students for review was a repetitive process so I decided to put at use what I've learned so far in Javascript to create a simple tool that given the name of a repo generate an easy to share message with links to both the repo and the live version and has the option to copy it to the clipboard.

### What I Learned

This wasn't an assignment but just a personal project to make a repetitive task a bit automated. I think it's a good sign as it shows I'm starting to think more like a programmer and finding ways to optimise iterations whenever possible and applying this thinking to my workflow.
